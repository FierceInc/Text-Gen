# Text-Gen

Generate dummy text for your apps and designs

This app is a work in progress and is Open-Source. It was developed to help spark creativity and new ideas from developers and designers, as we've found that using real text as a placeholder in your designs can help you come up with new ideas. 

Another purpose is to help with app testing, in the instance that your app is expecting large amounts of text from the user, this website can help you test such cases and you can also test how your text-to-speech apps handle any number of words without trying to come up with what to write or copying and pasting the same words over and over.
